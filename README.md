# gsplits
CLI Stopwatch designed for speedrun splitting

## Install
This has only been tested on Unix systems. It depends on `sqlite3`.
Clone this repository and run `make`.

## Usage
Run `gsplits` from a shell. It will walk you through setting up a category and a route. Once you have setup a 
route, you can enter the route directly by calling `gsplits <Name of Route>`
(Case sensitive, spaces are allowed.)
Once a run is started, press enter to go the next split.
